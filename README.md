Iris Species Prediction Web App

This web-based application predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its physical characteristics. The app uses a pre-trained Machine Learning model to make predictions based on user input for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

 Features
 Intuitive user interface for entering Iris flower measurements
 Real-time prediction of Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
 Responsive design for a better user experience

 Tech Stack
 Flask - Python web framework
 Scikit-learn - Machine Learning model (Decision Tree)
 HTML/CSS/Bootstrap - For the user interface
 Joblib - For loading the pre-trained model
 NumPy - For data handling

Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages.
3. Run the Flask app on your local machine.
4. Open your browser and interact with the web app.

Usage

 Input the flower's sepal and petal dimensions on the web form.
 Submit the form to get a prediction of the Iris species.
